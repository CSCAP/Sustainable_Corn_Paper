QUESTION: which system of crop production is more sustainable
          what are the goals for corn porduction systems
          address rain-fed areas
ANSWER:   we should be able to say that not all practices are sustainable  

NO3 loss
  - numeric crateria - load on no3
  - NO3 reduction based on hypoxia goal 
  - 45% reduction
Energy
  - there is no goal, like there is for NO3 loss
  - relative numbers can be used by comparing one cropping system with another, but this does not gives you any actionable     measures (what to implement ...)
  - what can be done to improve energy efficienty 
  - it should be focused on farmer-level changes 
  - should be relevant to the CSCAP project research
  - farmers adoppting corn with longer growing days can imporve harvest of solar energy better?
  - directional correctness (Rob staple phrase)
GHG
  - uncerttinty is huge 
  - compare GHG emission of different crop rotation 
Soil Errosion
  - regeneration of soil ~0.5 tons per acre 

SOC
- we do not have baseline?
- how to add more biomass carbon in to the system in order to make sustainable
- if climate changes 
- continuous no till can be 
- biometrition (multi-site, multi-year) Sasha?
- LOOK at the site-level differences of differences 


Drainage Data _________________________________________________________
- analysis Manage database
- roations that have conr in that 


- look at the CV of 40 to 60 cm of different depths 
- analyse at 0- 10 and  0-40 cm
- delta-delta SOC and CS

Meeting with Rick and Matt
- need to clean soil C and N data before analyzing it again
- start analyzing water data
  - total N loss by month
  - drainage flow by month
  - precipitation by month



12/12/2016

Look at the SOC data for individual sites:
  - WATERMAN
  - STJOHNS
  - FREEMAN
Look at TN for following sites:
  - FREEMAN
  - WATERMAN
Do C:R ratio plots  
Add plots
  - divers vs no-diversified crops
  - cover crop rotations vs no-cover rotations




Do all SOIL data analysis fpr CAP




12/2/2016


Add metadata
  - use  CAP data as a core and got outside data 

Publication produced by CAP that addresses issues related to this paper
  - need a new list of relevant papers 
  
Include GHG
  - reach Rob Annex and Mick Castelano
  

treat all SERF plots as CS

compare CS or COS 
  - in case of COS look at each layer 

Maybe Ecorigions can explain some of diversity in PLOT1
  - group by ecorigion instead of 

- make PLOT1 for First and Last year avarage individually 

- analyze %SOC the same way and TN
- analyze top 2 layeres 

WATER
- compare controlled vs free drainge 
- nitrate-n conc
- NO3-N loss

SOME IDEAS
from the conference

SOIL PAPER

- Al-Kaisi presentation in IMC:
    - crop rotation and tillage effect on yeild
    - listed factors effecting yield variability
    - manure application and cover crop along with no-tillage speed ups soil health build-up

- Archontoulis
    - has 3 sites with drainage and extensive data that can be added to TD
    - check their website 
    
    
    
    
1. Mahdi Ak-Kaisi
    Long-Term Tillage and Crop Rotation Effects on Soil, Yield, and Economic Returns
    
    - how management system effects soil carbon and soil health in general
    - today long-term study of tillage and cropping system (60 years)
      - how mngt effects soil
      - how such effect influence crop yield 
      - agro and eco outcome
      - variabilities of regioanl Yield
    
    Metrics for tillage and cropping system on soil
      - soil temp
      - soil organic matter
      - soil compuction and bulk density 
      - aggregate stability
      - infiltration
    all these will effect yield 
    
    Soil C Dynamics
    - long-term effects of crop rotation
      - cont corn rotation resulted 
          - more lost of C and
          - loss of bio-diversity in soil
      - tillage intensity increase loss of C
          - no-till 106 lb C/acre VS chisel plow 248 lb C/acre
    
    Water Recharge
    - decreases with intensity of tillage
    
    Yield
    - CS and CCS rotations
        - huge variablity in yeild because of the soil properties 
    - CC 
        - variability was high in all 7 sites despite of soil conditions
        - decimate macrobial veraibility when you apply a lot of fertilizers
    
    Economic Return ($/acre)
    - hieghest in CS, next CCS, the list profitable is CC (based on 7 research farms)
    
    FACTORS influancing regioanl Yield Variability
    - soil type, soil draiange, etc
    - soil temp (especially in early spring)
    - residue breakdwon (slower decomposition in colder areas)
    - differences in soil organic N mineralization
    - precipitation differences (timing, amount, etc)
    - weed pressure during wet seasons
    
    Residue Management on soil 
    
    SUMMARY
    - No yield difff in soybean among all tillage systems
    - Decline in corn yield in CC range 11-28 % comapred to CS
   
   
   
    
2.  

  - FACTS
    - consists of (a) Forcast tool and (b) Assessment tool
  - 3 sites without tile draiange and 3 sites with tilage drainge
    - frequency 30 min
    - measured:
        - soil
        - ground water
        - soil water
        - soil NO3
        - growth stage
        - root growth

    -  


3. John Sawyer
    - 16 years of data
    - site in Ames
    - different rate of N application 121 vs 148 lb N/acre
